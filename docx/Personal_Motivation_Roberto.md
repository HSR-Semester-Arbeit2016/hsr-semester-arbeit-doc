# Personal Motivation Roberto

I could divide my motivation's reasons in three big categories: the technological, the philanthropic and the personal ones.
The technological reasons are obvious: the possibility of entering in the AR and VR world and learning its technologies could not be more interesting. Although during the project we could see that these technologies are not yet fully developed and product-ready, the simple act of working "on the cutting-edge" was very exciting. 

The philanthropy arrives from the side of ASN. I am not a drinker and I personally suffered a loss in my youth exactly because the relationship between alcohol and cars. So It was really nice for me to have the opportunity of trying to help ASN in the battle against the alcohol. Even the smallest effort counts, and if in a given moment a young person remembers its experience with our App and doesn't drive being drunk, this would be more than enough for me.

The personal reasons are obvious for me too. The opportunity of working with my classmate and friend Konrad could not be better. In this weeks together I think we have become a good team, and despite of unexpected diseases I think we could make a good job.
I can not forget Prof. Augenstein. I've know him even before beginning the school. Both Konrad and I visited his Math lessons and could profit from his knowledge,  patience and support. And so went on in this term project.
